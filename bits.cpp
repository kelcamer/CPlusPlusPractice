typedef struct youngperson{
    unsigned int age : 5;
    // age contains only 5 bits.  2^5 = 32, so this can count to 32 distinct values.
    
    signed int signedage : 5;
    // if I don't specify unsigned, by default the number is signed, so it can express as many negative values as positive values.   As a result, this signed age can only count from -16 to 16, rather than 0 to 32, despite the fact that it is five bits. The reason for this is that the negative sign actually takes up the first bit.   Fascinating.
